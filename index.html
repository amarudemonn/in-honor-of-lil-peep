          Born in <em>Allentown</em>, <em>Pennsylvania</em>, and raised on <em>Long Island</em>, <em>New York</em>,

          pseudonym
          <span class="high-light-sec">Lil Peep</span> because his mother had called him <span
            class="high-light-sec">"Peep"</span>
          since he was a child. He soon became popular on the platform for his collaborations with <span
            class="high-light-sec">Lil Tracy</span>

          <em class="high-light-sec">Lil Peep; Part One (2015)</em>, <em class="high-light-sec">Live Forever
